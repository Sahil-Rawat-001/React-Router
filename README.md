# This is First way that I have learned how can we implement react router dom

This is very first way that I have learned and it is quite easy to understanding.

#Why we use React Router DOM instead of anchor tag <a/>

Because anchor tag allows web page to reload whenever a link is clicked 
But in react router DOM it does not reload the page when a link is clicked it
just update the changes on UI
